---------------------DATA BINDING-------------------

Data binding is communication between TS code (Business Logic) and Template (HTML)

1. String Interpolation {{  }}  (TS to HTML):
  html {{ var-name or method() }} 
  TS var-name="abc";

2. Property Binding:
  dynamically change DOM objects, for ex: [disabled]="!allowFromTS"

3. Event Binding:
  if we want to bind an event to a property in html meaning on click of a button trigger a method. Ex: HTML (click)="onCreateServer()"

$event browse
