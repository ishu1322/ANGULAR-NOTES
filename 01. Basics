---------------------DATA BINDING-------------------

Data binding is communication between TS code (Business Logic) and Template (HTML)

1. String Interpolation {{  }}  (TS to HTML):
  html {{ var-name or method() }} 
  TS var-name="abc";

2. Property Binding:
  dynamically change DOM objects, for ex: [disabled]="!allowFromTS"

3. Event Binding:
  if we want to bind an event to a property in html meaning on click of a button trigger a method. Ex: HTML (click)="onCreateServer()"

$event browse

4. Two- Binding: html [(ngModel)]="var-name"


------------------------ DIRECTIVES ---------------------------

Directives are Instructions in the DOM

Components:	Used with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type.

Attribute directives	: Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

Structural directives :	Change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.


<p *ngIf="true or false"> Content </p>
